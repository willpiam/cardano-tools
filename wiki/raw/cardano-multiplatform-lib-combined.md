# Cardano Multiplatform Lib

This is a library, written in Rust, that can be deployed to multiple platforms (Rust crate, JS, Typescript, WASM, etc). It handles:
- Serialization & deserialization of core data structures
- Builders to streamline and verify the construction of transactions and related components
- Useful utility functions for dApps & wallets

##### NPM packages

- browser: [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dcspark/cardano-multiplatform-lib-browser)
- nodejs: [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dcspark/cardano-multiplatform-lib-nodejs)

There is also an outdated asm.js . It is strongly discouraged from using this as it is out of date and asm.js results in incredibly slow cryptographic operations.
- asm.js (strongly discouraged): [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dcspark/cardano-multiplatform-lib-asmjs)

Note: If you are using WebPack, you must use version 5 or later for CML to work.

##### Rust crates

The rust crates are split up by functionality.

- core: [link](https://crates.io/crates/cml-core)
- crypto: [link](https://crates.io/crates/cml-crypto)
- chain: [link](https://crates.io/crates/cml-chain)
- multi-era: [link](https://crates.io/crates/cml-multi-era)
- cip25: [link](https://crates.io/crates/cml-cip25)
- cip36: [link](https://crates.io/crates/cml-cip36)

Most users will likely be using primarily `cml-chain` for general uses, `cml-multi-era` if they need historical (pre-babbage eras) chain-parsing and `cip25` or `cip36` if they need those specific metadata standards.

##### Mobile bindings

We recommend using Ionic + Capacitor or an equivalent setup to have the WASM bindings working in mobile


## Pre-requisite knowledge

This library assumes a certain amount of knowledge about how Cardano works (to avoid re-documenting the wheel).

You can find the specifications of Cardano's ledger [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs) which we suggest consulting as you use this library. Notably, the `Shelley ledger formal specification` covers the core concepts. Make sure to check the specs for later eras as well when needed.


## Benefits of using this library

Serialization/deserialization code is automatically generated from
Cardano’s official specification, which guarantees it can easily stay up
to date! We do this using a tool managed by EMURGO & dcSpark called `cddl-codegen`
which can be re-used for other tasks such as automatically generate a
Rust library for Cardano metadata specifications!

The most important feature of this is that CML has been generated to allow all CBOR details to be preserved.
With CBOR many CBOR structures can have multiple ways to serialize to bytes from the same equivalent structure.
This causes issues especially when computing hashes and is a frequent problem with working across tools e.g. cardano-node-cli and cardano-serialization-lib encoding plutus datums differently. This makes CML much more compatible with all other libraries as it will remember all these specific CBOR encoding details. This is particularly important for use with dApps and wallets connecting to dApps.

It is also very easy to create scripts in Rust or WASM to share with
stake pools, or even embed inside an online tool! No more crazy
cardano-cli bash scripts!

Powerful and flexible enough to be used to power wallets and exchanges!
(Yes, it’s used in production!)

## A note on code examples

All code examples are using the WASM (typescript/javascript) API. If you are using CML from rust you will need to change the code to rust syntax e.g. `Foo.bar()` to `Foo::new()` etc. We've tried to keep the API as consistent as possible between the different bindings but some exceptions exist. The array/map wrappers (e.g. `FooList` / `MapFooToBar`) in WASM are simply `Vec<Foo>` and `OrderedHashMap<Foo, Bar>` respectively. There will be some changes relating to reference params/moving/etc as well.

You can find complete examples in the `/examples/` directory.

## Documentation

This library generates `Typescript` type definitions, so it’s often easiest to see what is possible by just looking at the types! These are found in the `.ts` file in the npm package roots.
If you are using rust the full API will be shown in the respective crates.io pages.

## Example code

The example below builds a transaction with all 2 of the 3 input types: key and bootstrap.
Multisig (script) inputs are essentially identical to key inputs, but using the scripthash instead of the keyhash, however they are not supported for implicit fee calculation yet.
Fees are automatically calculated and sent to a change address in the example.


```javascript
// instantiate the tx builder with the Cardano protocol parameters - these may change later on
const txBuilder = makeTxBuilder();
const testnetId = 0;
// add a keyhash input - for ADA held in a Shelley-era normal address (Base, Enterprise, Pointer)
const prvKey = CML.PrivateKey.from_bech32("ed25519e_sk16rl5fqqf4mg27syjzjrq8h3vq44jnnv52mvyzdttldszjj7a64xtmjwgjtfy25lu0xmv40306lj9pcqpa6slry9eh3mtlqvfjz93vuq0grl80");
const inputAddr = CML.EnterpriseAddress.new(testnetId, CML.StakeCredential.new_key(prvKey.to_public().hash())).to_address();
txBuilder.add_input(CML.SingleInputBuilder.new(
    CML.TransactionInput.new(
        CML.TransactionHash.from_hex("8561258e210352fba2ac0488afed67b3427a27ccf1d41ec030c98a8199bc22ec"), // tx hash
        0, // index
    ),
    CML.TransactionOutput.new(
        inputAddr,
        CML.Value.from_coin(BigInt(6000000)),
    )
);

// base address
const outputAddress = CML.Address.from_bech32("addr_test1qpu5vlrf4xkxv2qpwngf6cjhtw542ayty80v8dyr49rf5ewvxwdrt70qlcpeeagscasafhffqsxy36t90ldv06wqrk2qum8x5w");
// pointer address
const changeAddress = CML.Address.from_bech32("addr_test1gz2fxv2umyhttkxyxp8x0dlpdt3k6cwng5pxj3jhsydzerspqgpsqe70et");

// add output to the tx
txBuilder.add_output(
    CML.TransactionOutputBuilder()
        .with_address(outputAddress)
        .next()
        .with_value(CML.Value.from_coin(BigInt(1000000)))
        .build()
);

// calculate the min fee required and send any change to an address
// this moves onto the next step of building the transaction: providing witnesses
const signedTxBuilder = tx_builder.build(
    changeAddress,
    CML.ChangeSelectionAlgo.Default
);

// sign with the key that owns the input used
signedTxBuilder.add_vkey(CML.make_vkey_witness(txHash, prvKey));

const tx = signedTxBuilder.build_checked();
// ready to submit, can be converted to CBOR via tx.to_cbor_bytes() or to_cbor_hex() for hex
```

## A note on fees

Fees in Cardano are based directly on the size of the final encoded transaction. It is important to note that a transaction created by this library potentially can vary in size compared to one built with other tools. This is because transactions, as well as other Cardano structures, are encoded using [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) a binary JSON-like encoding. Due to arrays and maps allowing both definite or indefinite length encoding in the encoded transaction created by the library, the size can vary. This is because definite encoding consists of a tag containing the size of the array/map which can be 1 or more bytes long depending on the number of elements the size of the encoded structure, while indefinite length encoding consists of a 1 byte starting tag and after all elements are listed, a 1 byte ending tag. These variances should should only be a couple bytes and cardano-multiplatform-lib uses definite encoding by default which is the same length or smaller for any reasonable sized transaction.

# TransactionBuilder

In order to simplify transaction creation, we provide a `TransactionBuilder` struct that manages witnesses, fee calculation, change addresses and such. Assume we have instantiated an instance under the variable `builder` for this explanation. The `TransactionBuilder` requires several protocol parameters governing Cardano to be created which is shown in the following section. These are specified initially in the genesis file for Cardano nodes.

The minimum required for a valid transaction is to add inputs, outputs, and either set the fee explicitly with `builder.set_fee(fee)`, or calculate it implicitly using `builder.add_change_if_needed(address)`.
Optionally a transaction can also have certificates, reward withdrawals, metadata, and minting added to it.
Any change made to the builder can impact the size and thus the fee so the fee should be the last thing set.
If implicitly setting the fee any extra ADA (`inputs + withdrawals - outputs + refund - deposit - min fee`) is sent to the provided change address.
Fees must be sufficient, i.e. `inputs + withdrawals + refund >= outputs + deposit + fee` which must be manually ensured if you explicitly set the fee. Any extra fee is not necessary and the extra ADA beyond that will be burned.
Once the transaction is ready, `const body = builder.build()` can be called to return a ready `TransactionBody`.

Withdrawals are ADA withdrawn as part of the rewards generated by staking and deposits are refundable ADA locked while resources such as stake certificates or pool registrations exist on the blockchain. They are returned as refunds when these resources are deregistered/retired.

To get to a transaction ready to post on the blockchain, we must create a `Transaction` from that, which consists of the `TransactionBody`, a matching `TransactionWitnessSet` and optionally an `AuxiliaryData`.
The witnesses and optional metadata must match those provided to the builder. The witnesses must sign the hash of the transaction body returned by `hash_transaction(body)`. In addition to the witnesses for inputs, withdrawals and some certificates require witnesses as well. For example, staking address registration does not require a witness while stake address de-registration requires one. For any questions or doubts about the rules governing fees, deposits, rewards, certificates or which witness types are required refer to the [specs for the relevant era](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs#cardano-ledger), specifically the Shelley design specification for general design for non-governance certificates. Refer to the Conway specs for those. The formal specification could be useful for specific details as well. The design spec contains details about which certificates require which type of witnesses in the Certificates and Registrations section.

# TransactionBuilderConfig

To correctly make transactions the builder must know some on-chain parameters such as the current fee costs, key deposits, etc. These can all potentially change, even if some have largely been static for large periods of time. We pass these into the builder via the `TransactionBuilderConfigBuilder`. For test things out hard-coding them might suffice, but these parameters should ideally be fetched from the current blockchain head or your transactions could fail to be accepted by the network or will end up paying higher fees. The cost models parameter is optional if you are not building a transaction that utilizes Plutus smart contracts.

Code examples for the builders will assume you have a `make_tx_builder()` function that creates a `TransactionBuilder` with the appropriate config.

# Blockfrost

One way of getting this information is via the `epochs/latest/parameters` endpoint of blockfrost. This can be automated from rust using the `cml-blockfrost` crate's `make_tx_builder_cfg()`. Blockfrost is by no means necessary but it can be convenient. It is possible to get this information by other means as well e.g. having a synced cardano node.

Using `cml-blockfrost` (rust):

```rust
let cfg = cml_blockfrost::make_tx_builder_cfg(&api).await.unwrap();
let mut tx_builder = TransactionBuilder::new(cfg);
```

This could also be done manually similar to below (or reference `cml-blockfrost`'s code)

Manually using WASM:

```javascript
let params = await blockfrost.epochsLatestParameters();

// cost order is based on lex ordering of keys
let costModels = CML.CostModels.new();
let v1Costs = params.cost_models['PlutusV1'];
if (v1Costs != null) {
    let v1CMLCosts = CML.IntList.new();
    for (key in Object.keys(v1Costs).toSorted()) {
        v1CMLCosts.add(CML.Int.new(v1Costs[key]));
    }
    costModels.set_plutus_v1(v1CMLCosts);
}
// cost order is based on lex ordering of keys
let v2Costs = params.cost_models['PlutusV2'];
if (v2Costs != null) {
    let v2CMLCosts = CML.IntList.new();
    for (key in Object.keys(v2Costs).toSorted()) {
        v2CMLCosts.add(CML.Int.new(v2Costs[key]));
    }
    costModels.set_plutus_v2(v2CMLCosts);
}
// note: as of writing this the sancho testnet format is different for v3
// compared to v1/v2. this may remain true once mainnet switches over so
// please inspect the object you are getting for cost models from blockfrost

let configBuilder = CML.TransactionBuilderConfigBuilder.new()
    .fee_algo(CML.LinearFee.new(params.min_fee_a, params.min_fee_b))
    .coins_per_utxo_byte(BigNum(params.coins_per_utxo_size))
    .pool_deposit(BigNum(params.pool_deposit))
    .key_deposit(BigNum(params.key_deposit))
    .max_value_size(Number(params.max_val_size))
    .max_tx_size(params.max_tx_size)
    .ex_unit_prices(CML.ExUnitPrices.new(
        CML.SubCoin.from_base10_f32(params.price_mem),
        CML.SubCoin.from_base10_f32(params.price_step)
    ))
    .cost_models(costModels)
    .collateral_percentage(params.collateral_percent)
    max_collateral_inputs(params.max_collateral_inputs);
let mut txBuilder = CML.TransactionBuilder.new(configBuilder.build());

# CBOR

Cardano on-chain types are stored using [CBOR](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7049), a data format similar to JSON but with many more features and in binary.

## Tool Interoperability (AKA Why is the hash different?)

Due to CBOR's flexibility it is possible that one piece of CBOR can be represented in multiple ways in the binary encoding. This causes problems when using CBOR taken on-chain or from another tool and using it with another tool. Notably, one small difference in the binary encoding of CBOR could result in hashes being totally different. e.g. metadatum hashes or transaction hashes calculated in a dApp might be different than in the wallet causing the entire transaction to be rejected by the network.

CML solves this by supporting automatically every single possible CBOR encoding variation. On-chain types created by deserializing from CBOR bytes will remember these details and re-serializing will use them and result in the same CBOR bytes, unlike some other tools.

As a real-world example let's look at a simple plutus datum 

```javascript
let datum = PlutusData.new_constr_plutus_data(ConstrPlutusData.new(0, [PlutusData.new_bytes(0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF)]));
```

If we seralized this we would get the bytes `d8798144deadbeef`. However, some tools, such as CSL or Lucid would arrive at a longer `d8799f44deadbeefff`, both of which represent the same underlying data. Hashing `datum` would likewise result in a different hash than computed by such other tools.

If we wanted to match the tool that created it we would instead do
```javascript
let datum = PlutusData.from_cbor_hex("d8799f44deadbeefff");
```

which when hashed would, in this instance, match that other tool, and when re-serialized would give the same original bytes.

The important thing to remember here is that even this simple datum (variant 0 with a single DEADBEEF byte string) has over 50000 ways to represent it in CBOR bytes, and thus over 50000 different hashes. You should never rely on two tools except when using a protocol that requires canonical CBOR. Even if two tools match on one datum, or 1000, does not mean they will always match on another slightly different one. The Cardano protocol in general does not require canonical CBOR and thus you must support all such possible encodings. One advantage of CML over other tools is that, when creating things from bytes e.g. `PlutusData.from_cbor_hex()`, everything is handled for you.

Once a datum or other on-chain structure has been created you should always from that point onward be creating it or hashing it only from the original cbor bytes. This applies to any hashing of (non-canonical) CBOR in general, not just with Cardano.

In the rare situation where for some reason this is not possible e.g. you absolutely have to interface with another non-CBOR-preserving tool after creation that breaks hashes like Lucid/CSL, then for plutus datums in particular we offer `PlutusData.to_cardano_node_format()` which will force the datum to encode in the way those two tools currently use. This should only ever be used when working with `PlutusData.from_cbor_hex()/PlutusData.from_cbor_bytes()` is not possible e.g. when CML creates the datum and then submits it to a tool/protocol using CSL/Lucid to parse it which does not respect the original encodings and forces their specific encoding/hash. Those tools currently use the default format that cardano CLI currently uses when creating datums but all of these are just implementation details that could change so be warned.

## Rust

On-chan types in rust can (de)serialize to/from CBOR Via the `Serialize`/`Deserialize` and `ToBytes`/`FromBytes` traits located within the `cml_core::serialize` module.

Most on-chain types implement the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits. These traits guarantee that all CBOR encoding details are preserved upon deserialization and upon serialization it is possible to choose between canonical CBOR encoding and arbitrary encodings (the original it was decoded from).

Byron-era types do not implement `Serialize`/`Deserialize` and instead implement `ToBytes`/`FromBytes`. Byron on-chain types are always in canonical CBOR so this was not necessary.

The types in the `cip25` module also do not support `Serialize`/`Deserialize` in favor of `ToBytes`/`FromBytes`. The underlying metadata on-chain does and you should use the types in`cml_core::metadata`

```rust
use cml_core::serialization::{Serialize, Deserialize};
let canonical_cbor_hex = "825820aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa01";
// these all represent the following CBOR:
// [ ; array of 2 elements (transaction input struct)
//    0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, ; bytes (tx hash)
//    1 ; unsigned integer (tx index)
// ]
let non_canonical_cbor = [
    canonical_cbor_hex,
    "825820aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1a00000001",
    "9f5f48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaff01ff",
    "9900025820aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa190001",
    "9b00000000000000025f41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aaff1b0000000000000001",
];
for orig_cbor_hex in non_canonical_cbor {
    let tx_in = TransactionInput::from_cbor_bytes(&hex::decode(orig_cbor_hex).unwrap()).unwrap();
    // serialize back to cbor bytes using the same cbor encoding details so it will match
    // the format where it came from
    assert_eq!(hex::encode(tx_in.to_cbor_bytes()), orig_cbor_hex);
    // no matter how it was created it will represent the same data and can be encoded to
    // canonical cbor bytes which will be the same as all of these are the same transaction input
    assert_eq!(hex::encode(tx_in.to_canonical_cbor_bytes()), canonical_cbor_hex);
}
```

## WASM

All on-chain types have the traits directly exposed on each struct as the methods:
* `.to_cbor_bytes()`
* `.to_canonical_cbor_bytes()`
* `.from_cbor_bytes()`
* `.to_cbor_hex()`
* `.to_canonical_cbor_hex()`
* `.from_cbor_hex()`

The hex ones are useful for working with CIP-30 (dApp connector).

On post-Byron on-chain types this delegates to `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (see rust section) and preserve round-trip always. CIP25 and Byron types will always serialize to canonical CBOR. All on-chain data during the Byron era has to be canonical CBOR so this is not a big issue but is worth noting.

```javascript
let canonicalCborHex = "825820aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa01";
// these all represent the following CBOR:
// [ ; array of 2 elements (transaction input struct)
//    0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, ; bytes (tx hash)
//    1 ; unsigned integer (tx index)
// ]
let nonCanonicalCbor = [
    canonicalCborHex,
    "825820aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1a00000001",
    "9f5f48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa48aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaff01ff",
    "9900025820aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa190001",
    "9b00000000000000025f41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aa41aaff1b0000000000000001",
];
for (let origCborHex of nonCanonicalCbor) {
    let txIn = CML.TransactionInput.from_cbor_hex(orig_cbor_hex);
    // serialize back to cbor bytes using the same cbor encoding details so it will match
    // the format where it came from
    console.assert(txIn.to_cbor_hex() == origCborHex);
    // no matter how it was created it will represent the same data and can be encoded to
    // canonical cbor bytes which will be the same as all of these are the same transaction input
    console.assert(txIn.to_canonical_cbor_hex() == canonicalCborHex);
}

# CIP25


## Context 
[CIP25](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip25/) defines an NFT Metadata Standard for Native Tokens.

Since tokens on Cardano are a part of the UTxO ledger, the metadata isn't directly attached to a token, but instead stored in the transaction data.

When data is transmitted or stored in Cardano, it is often encoded as CBOR bytes to optimize space and facilitate fast processing. CBOR provides a standardized way to encode complex data structures, making it easier for different components of the Cardano ecosystem to interact and interpret the data.




Below is the entire metadata schema for CIP-25, which can be parsed by passing in the CBOR bytes of the entire transaction metadata
or by passing in an existing Metadata struct.

Parsing from CBOR bytes should be marginally faster.

```
{
      "721": {
        "<policy_id>": {
          "<asset_name>": {
            "name": <string>,
    
            "image": <uri | array>,
            "mediaType": image/<mime_sub_type>,
    
            "description": <string | array>,
    
            "files": [{
              "name": <string>,
              "mediaType": <mime_type>,
              "src": <uri | array>,
              <other_properties>
            }],
    
            <other properties>
          }
        },
        "version": <version_id>
      }
    }
```


## Code Definitions

- `CIP25Metadata` struct is the top-level struct for CIP-25 metadata, and contains a `key_721` field of type `LabelMetadata`. The key_721 field will contain either a LabelMetadataV1 or LabelMetadataV2 instance.

- `LabelMetadata` defines an enum type that can contain either a `LabelMetadataV1` or `LabelMetadataV2` instance. It also provides functions for creating instances of each type.

- `MetadataDetails` defines a struct that represents metadata details for a specific asset. It contains fields for the asset name, an image associated with the asset, a media type, a description, and details about any associated files. The `new()` method creates a new instance with the specified name and image, and sets the other fields to None.



## Examples


### Create

The following example shows how to create and populate the CIP25 metadata schema with the available structs.

```rust
    let mut details = MetadataDetails::new(
        String64::try_from("Metadata Name").unwrap(),
        ChunkableString::from("htts://some.website.com/image.png"),
    );    
    details.description = Some(ChunkableString::from("description of this NFT"));
    details.media_type = Some(String64::try_from("image/*").unwrap());
    details.files = Some(vec![
        FilesDetails::new(
            String64::new_str("filename1").unwrap(),
            String64::new_str("filetype1").unwrap(),
            ChunkableString::from("src1"),
        ),
        FilesDetails::new(
            String64::new_str("filename2").unwrap(),
            String64::new_str("filetype2").unwrap(),
            ChunkableString::from("src2"),
        ),
    ]);
    let mut v2 = Data::new();
    let mut v2_inner = BTreeMap::new();
    v2_inner.insert(AssetNameV2::from(vec![0xCA, 0xFE, 0xD0, 0x0D]), details);
    v2.insert(PolicyIdV2::from(vec![0xBA, 0xAD, 0xF0, 0x0D]), v2_inner);

    let metadata = CIP25Metadata::new(LabelMetadata::new_label_metadata_v2(
        LabelMetadataV2::new(v2),

    ));
    println!("{metadata:?}");

```

**output:**

```

### Loose Parse Metadata details

The `loose_parse()` function allows parsing of certain data that is technically non-compliant with CIP25 due to minor mistakes by their creators. 


:::note
This function should only to be used to parse non conformant metadata, since it will return a different struct (MiniMetadataDetails) which will just (possibly)return the name/image. 

It's best to only use it as a fallback when the regular parsing fails.
:::

#### Just name

```rust
// {"name":"Metaverse"}
let details = MiniMetadataDetails::loose_parse(&TransactionMetadatum::from_bytes(hex::decode("a1646e616d65694d6574617665727365").unwrap()).unwrap()).unwrap();
println!("{details:?}")
```

ouput:
```
MiniMetadataDetails { 
    name: Some(String64("Metaverse")), 
    image: None 
}
```

# Core

This crate is for core features and traits common to all CML crates. Most users likely won't need to directly use this module except for possibly pulling in traits used with other cml crates. If you are using CML from WASM/typescript this module will not be needed as any used types will be re-exported in the crates (e.g. cml-chain-wasm, cml-cip25-wasm, etc) that use it.

# Generating Keys and Addresses

## BIP32 Keys

There are two main categories of keys in this library. There are the raw `PublicKey` and `PrivateKey` which are used for cryptographically signing/verifying, and `BIP32PrivateKey`/`BIP32PublicKey` which in addition to this have the ability to derive additional keys from them following the [BIP32 derivation scheme](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032) variant called BIP32-Ed25519, which will be referred to as BIP32 for brevity. We use the [BIP44 spec](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0044) variant for Ed25519 as well for the derivation paths using 1852 or 44 as the purpose consant and 1815 for the coin type depending on address type. See [this doc](https://github.com/input-output-hk/implementation-decisions/pull/18) for more details.

This is demonstrated with the below code
```javascript
function harden(num: number): number {
  return 0x80000000 + num;
}


const rootKey = CardanoWasm.BIP32PrivateKey.from_bech32("xprv17qx9vxm6060qjn5fgazfue9nwyf448w7upk60c3epln82vumg9r9kxzsud9uv5rfscxp382j2aku254zj3qfx9fx39t6hjwtmwq85uunsd8x0st3j66lzf5yn30hwq5n75zeuplepx8vxc502txx09ygjgx06n0p");
const accountKey = rootKey
  .derive(harden(1852)) // purpose
  .derive(harden(1815)) // coin type
  .derive(harden(0)); // account #0

const utxoPubKey = accountKey
  .derive(0) // external
  .derive(0)
  .to_public();

const stakeKey = accountKey
  .derive(2) // chimeric
  .derive(0)
  .to_public();
```

## BIP39 Entropy

To generate a `BIP32PrivateKey` from a BIP39 recovery phrase it must be first converted to entropy following the BIP39 protocol(). This library does not directly handle that, but once entropy is created it is possible to use `Bip32PrivateKey.from_bip39_entropy(entropy, password)`. For more information see the [CIP3](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/3) Cardano improvement proposal. The code below uses the `bip39` npm package to generate a root `BIP32PrivateKey` from a BIP39 mnemonic.

```javascript
import { mnemonicToEntropy } from 'bip39';

const entropy = mnemonicToEntropy(
  [ "test", "walk", "nut", "penalty", "hip", "pave", "soap", "entry", "language", "right", "filter", "choice" ].join(' ')
);

const rootKey = CardanoWasm.Bip32PrivateKey.from_bip39_entropy(
  Buffer.from(entropy, 'hex'),
  Buffer.from(''),
);
```

## Use in Addresses

Once we have reached the desired derivation path, we must convert the `BIP32PrivateKey` or `BIP32PublicKey` to a `PrivateKey` or `PublicKey` by calling `.to_raw_key()` on them with the exception of Byron addresses.
For example, to create an address using the `utxoPubKey` and `stakeKey` in the first example, we can do:
```javascript
// base address with staking key
const baseAddr = CardanoWasm.BaseAddress.new(
  CardanoWasm.NetworkInfo.mainnet().network_id(),
  CardanoWasm.StakeCredential.from_keyhash(utxoPubKey.to_raw_key().hash()),
  CardanoWasm.StakeCredential.from_keyhash(stakeKey.to_raw_key().hash()),
);

// enterprise address without staking ability, for use by exchanges/etc
const enterpriseAddr = CardanoWasm.EnterpriseAddress.new(
  CardanoWasm.NetworkInfo.mainnet().network_id(),
  CardanoWasm.StakeCredential.from_keyhash(utxoPubKey.to_raw_key().hash())
);

// pointer address - similar to Base address but can be shorter, see formal spec for explanation
const ptrAddr = CardanoWasm.PointerAddress.new(
  CardanoWasm.NetworkInfo.mainnet().network_id(),
  CardanoWasm.StakeCredential.from_keyhash(utxoPubKey.to_raw_key().hash()),
  CardanoWasm.Pointer.new(
    100, // slot
    2,   // tx index in slot
    0    // cert indiex in tx
  )
);

// reward address - used for withdrawing accumulated staking rewards
const rewardAddr = CardanoWasm.RewardAddress.new(
  CardanoWasm.NetworkInfo.mainnet().network_id(),
  CardanoWasm.StakeCredential.from_keyhash(stakeKey.to_raw_key().hash())
);

// bootstrap address - byron-era addresses with no staking rights
const byronAddr = CardanoWasm.ByronAddress.icarus_from_key(
  utxoPubKey, // Ae2* style icarus address
  CardanoWasm.NetworkInfo.mainnet().protocol_magic()
);
```

Note that the byron-era address can only be created in this library from icarus-style addresses that start in `Ae2` and that Daedalus-style addresses starting in `Dd` are not directly supported.

These are all address variant types with information specific to its address type. There is also an `Address` type which represents any of those variants, which is the type use in most parts of the library. For example to create a `TransactionOutput` manually we would have to first convert from one of the address variants by doing:
```javascript
const address = baseAddress.to_address();

const output = CardanoWasm.TransactionOutput(address, BigNum.from_str("365"));
```
If the address is already a Shelley address in raw bytes or a bech32 string we can create it directly via:
```javascript
const addr = CardanoWasm.Address.from_bech32("addr1vyt3w9chzut3w9chzut3w9chzut3w9chzut3w9chzut3w9cj43ltf");

```


## Other Key Types

Conversion between `cardano-cli` 128-byte `XPrv` keys and `BIP32PrivateKey` is also supported:
```javascript
const bip32PrivateKey = CardanoWasm.BIP32PrivateKey.from_128_xprv(xprvBytes);
assert(xprvBytes == CardanoWasm.BIP32PrivateKey.to_128_xprv());
```
96-byte `XPrv` keys are identical to `BIP32PrivateKey`s byte-wise and no conversion is needed.
For more details see [this document](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/stake-pool-operations/keys_and_addresses.html) regarding legacy keys.

There is also `LegacyDaedalusPrivateKey` which is used for creating witnesses for legacy Daedalus `Dd`-type addresses.

# JSON

## General structs

All on-chain types have to/from JSON support. The vast majority is auto-generated but some have custom logic e.g. `Url`, `Ipv4`, `BigInteger`, etc.

### WASM

In WASM JSON conversions are exposed by `.to_json()` and `.from_json()` methods on all supported wrappers. There is also a `to_js_value()`.

```javascript
let txInJson = "{\"transaction_id\":\"0fba1404ed9b82b41938ba2e8bda7bec8cce813fb7e7cd7692b43caa76fe891c\",\"index\":3}";

let txIn = CML.TransactionInput.from_json(txInJson);

console.log(`txIn JSON: ${txIn.to_json()}`);
```

### Rust

JSON conversions are exposed in rust via the [`serde::Serialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Serialize.html) and [`serde::Deserialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Deserialize.html) traits together with `serde_json`.

example:
```rust
let tx_in_json = "{\"transaction_id\":\"0fba1404ed9b82b41938ba2e8bda7bec8cce813fb7e7cd7692b43caa76fe891c\",\"index\":3}";

// from JSON using serde_json::from_str() - note the type annotations
let tx_in: TransactionInput = serde_json::from_str(tx_in_json).unwrap();

// to JSON using serde_json::to_string() - use to_string_pretty() if you want more human-readable formatting
println!("tx_in JSON: {}", serde_json::to_string(&tx_in).unwrap());
```

## Metadata

Metadata, on top of the generic API mentioned above, has specific JSON functionality for compatability with cardano-node.

There are three formats on `MetadataJsonSchema`. `NoConversions` is the stricted, stricter than cardano-node and only converts when there are no implicit conversions at all. `BasicConversions` is the node's `TxMetadataJsonNoSchema` and `DetailedSchema` its `TxMetadataJsonDetailedSchema`. See `MetadataJsonSchema` for more info on the schema.

```javascript
let basic_json = "{\"0x8badf00d\": \"0xdeadbeef\",\"9\": 5,\"obj\": {\"a\":[{\"5\": 2},{}]}}";
let metadatum = CML.encode_json_str_to_metadatum(basic_json, CML.MetadataJsonSchema.BasicConversions);
console.log(`detailed json: ${CML.decode_metadatum_to_json_str(metadatum, CML.MetadataJsonSchema.DetailedSchema)}`);
// OUTPUT:
// detailed json: {"map":[{"k":{"bytes":"8badf00d"},"v":{"bytes":"deadbeef"}},{"k":{"int":9},"v":{"int":5}},{"k":{"string":"obj"},"v":{"map":[{"k":{"string":"a"},"v":{"list":[{"map":[{"k":{"int":5},"v":{"int":2}}]},{"map":[]}]}}]}}]}
```

## Plutus Datums

Plutus datums also have additional cardano-node JSON support. Remember that Plutus has no String datum so the strings there will be converted to utf8 bytes. See `CardanoNodePlutusDatumSchema` for more info on the schema.

```javascript
let basic_json = "{ \"100\": [ { \"x\": \"0\", \"y\": 1 } ], \"foo\": \"0x0000baadf00d0000cafed00d0000deadbeef0000\" }";
let datum = CML.encode_json_str_to_plutus_datum(basic_json, CML.CardanoNodePlutusDatumSchema.BasicConversions);
console.log(`detailed json: ${CML.decode_plutus_datum_to_json_str(datum, CML.CardanoNodePlutusDatumSchema.DetailedSchema,
)}`);
// OUTPUT:
// detailed json: {"map":[{"k":{"int":100},"v":{"list":[{"map":[{"k":{"bytes":"78"},"v":{"bytes":"30"}},{"k":{"bytes":"79"},"v":{"int":1}}]}]}},{"k":{"bytes":"666f6f"},"v":{"bytes":"0000baadf00d0000cafed00d0000deadbeef0000"}}]}
```

# Metadata

## Transaction Metadata format

Transaction after the Shelley hardfork can contain arbitrary transaction meta (**note:** this is NOT the same as pool metadata)

Transaction metadata takes the form of a map of metadatums, which are recursive JSON-like structures.

It is defined in [CDDL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8610), a schema grammar for representing [CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049) binary encoding as:
```
transaction_metadatum =
    { * transaction_metadatum => transaction_metadatum }
  / [ * transaction_metadatum ]
  / int
  / bytes .size (0..64)
  / text .size (0..64)

transaction_metadatum_label = uint

transaction_metadata =
  { * transaction_metadatum_label => transaction_metadatum }
```

For each use we use a metadatum label specific to our use into the `TransactionMetadatum` map. If we had a JSON object such as
```json
{
  "receiver_id": "SJKdj34k3jjKFDKfjFUDfdjkfd",
  "sender_id": "jkfdsufjdk34h3Sdfjdhfduf873",
  "comment": "happy birthday",
  "tags": [0, 264, -1024, 32]
}
```

There are 4 ways we can achieve this with different trade-offs:

1) Directly use: using the Metadata-related structures used in the library
2) JSON conversion: conversion to/from JSON using our utility functions
3) CDDL subset: writing a CDDL spec of this structure that is representable by that recursive metadatum CDDL
4) Raw bytes: encoding raw-bytes using our utility functions.

Each section will give examples of how to encode a similar structure. Understanding CDDL is only necessary for the last 2 options, but it is fairly simple to understand.

If your metadata schema is fixed and will be used frequently you should consider the CDDL spec option.
If your schema is not often used or used from many languages, the JSON option can be good as it is low set-up and fairly tech agnostic.
If your schema is very dynamic or non-existent, the direct use or JSON options are likely best.
The raw bytes option is only recommended if your data does not conform to the metadata format.

## Metadata limitations

These limitations are mentioned in the CDDL definition, but are worth also mentioning in prose:

- Strings must be at most 64 bytes when UTF-8 encoded.
- Bytestrings are hex-encoded, with a maximum length of 64 bytes.

## Direct use

Upsides:
* Flexible
* Readable by other methods

Downsides:
* Can be quite tedious to write
* Structural validation must be done by hand (partially)

As the metadatum structure is fairly expressive, we can directly use it using the structs in the metadata module of this library. These directly represent the types given in the CDDL. Namely:
* TransactionMetadatum - Can represent one of those 5 variant types.
* MetadataMap - The map variant that maps from metadatums to other metadatums. This is unordered and indexed by metadatums. This is like an object in JSON.
* MetadataList - An ordered list indexed starting at 0. This is like an array in JSON.

The variants for numbers, bytes and text are not specific to metadata and are directly used with the general `Int` type representing a signed or unsigned number, byte arrays accepting byte arrays/`Buffer`, and strings being JS strings.

We could construct the JSON example above with the following code:
```javascript
const map = CardanoWasm.MetadataMap.new();
map.insert(
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("receiver_id"),
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("SJKdj34k3jjKFDKfjFUDfdjkfd"),
);
map.insert(
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("sender_id"),
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("jkfdsufjdk34h3Sdfjdhfduf873"),
);
map.insert(
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("comment"),
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("happy birthday"),
);
const tags = CardanoWasm.MetadataList.new();
tags.add(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_int(CardanoWasm.Int.new(CardanoWasm.BigNum.from_str("0"))));
tags.add(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_int(CardanoWasm.Int.new(CardanoWasm.BigNum.from_str("264"))));
tags.add(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_int(CardanoWasm.Int.new_negative(CardanoWasm.BigNum.from_str("1024"))));
tags.add(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_int(CardanoWasm.Int.new(CardanoWasm.BigNum.from_str("32"))));
map.insert(
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("tags"),
  CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_list(tags),
);
const metadatum = CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_map(map);
```

We could then parse the information back as such:
```javascript
try {
  const map = metadatum.as_map();
  const receiver = map.get(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("receiver_id"));
  const sender = map.get(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("sender_id"));
  const comment = map.get(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("comment"));
  const tags = map.get(CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatum.new_text("tags"));
} catch (e) {
  // structure did not match
}
```

For decoding in a more exploratory manner we can check the types first as such:
```javascript
function parseMetadata(metadata) {
  // we must check the type first to know how to handle it
  switch (metadata.kind()) {
    case CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatumKind.MetadataMap:
      const mapRet = new Map();
      const map = metadata.as_map();
      const keys = maps.keys();
      for (var i = 0; i < keys.len(); i += 1) {
        const key = keys.get(i);
        const value = parseMetadata(map.get(key);
        mapRet.set(key, value);
      }
      return mapRet;
    case CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatumKind.MetadataList:
      let arrRet = [];
      const arr = metadata.as_list();
      for (var i = 0; i < arr.len(); i += 1) {
        const elem = parseMetadata(arr.get(i));
        arrRet.push(elem);
      }
      return arrRet;
    case CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatumKind.Int:
      const x = metadata.as_int();
      // If the integer is too big as_i32() returns undefined
      // to handle larger numbers we need to use x.as_positive() / x.as_negative() and
      // convert from BigNums after checking x.is_positive() first
      return x.as_i32();
    case CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatumKind.Bytes:
      return Buffer.from(metadata.as_bytes());
    case CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadatumKind.Text:
      return metadata.as_text();
  }
}
```
which recursively parses the `TransactionMetadatum` struct and transforms it into a JS `Map` / JS `object` structure by manually checking the types.


## JSON conversion

Upsides:
* Flexible
* Readable by other methods
* Lowest set-up work involved

Downsides:
* Does not support negative integers between `-2^64 + 1` and `-2^63` (serde_json library restriction)
* Structural validation must be done by hand
* Can use more space as string keyed maps are likely to be used more than arrays would be in the CDDL solutions

```javascript
const obj = {
  receiver_id: "SJKdj34k3jjKFDKfjFUDfdjkfd",
  sender_id: "jkfdsufjdk34h3Sdfjdhfduf873",
  comment: "happy birthday",
  tags: [0, 264, -1024, 32]
};
const metadata = CardanoWasm.encode_json_str_to_metadatum(JSON.stringify(obj), CardanoWasm.MetadataJsonSchema.NoConversions);
const metadataString = CardanoWasm.decode_metadatum_to_json_str(metadata, CardanoWasm.MetadataJsonSchema.NoConversions);
```

To support an extended set of metadata we also support 3 additional modes for JSON conversion following IOHK's [cardano-node JSON schemas](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/cardano-api/src/Cardano/Api/TxMetadata.hs).

The three modes are:
* `NoConversions` - Faithfully converts between the minimal shared feature set between JSON and Metadata
* `BasicConversions` - Adds additional support for byte(as hex strings)/integers (as strings) keys / byte (as hex strings) values.
* `DetailedSchema` - Can convert almost all metadata into a specific JSON schema but is very verbose on the JSON side.

Details on the formats can be found in our library's metadata module or in the `cardano-node` file linked above. `DetailedSchema` is likely most useful if you need to parse any possible kind of metadata into JSON specifically, possibly to display or for debugging.
For most reasonable schemas `NoConversions` should suffice, or `BasicConversions` if byte/string keys and byte values are needed.
If you are in charge of your own schema and you do not need arbitrary keys, it is recommended not to use `DetailedSchema` as it is significantly more complicated to use.

The additions of `BasicConversions` are demonstrated below
```json
{
  "0x8badf00d": "0xdeadbeef",
  "9": 5,
  "obj": {
    "a":[
      {
        "5": 2
      },
      {
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
which creates a map with 3 elements:
* 4 byte bytestring (0x8badf00d) => 4 byte bytestring (0xdeadbeef)
* int (9) => int (5)
* string ("obj") => object (string ("a") => list [ object (int (5) => int (2)), object (empty) ])

All bytestrings must be prefixed with "0x" or they will be treated as regular strings.
All strings that parse as an integer such as "125" will be treated as a metadata integer.

The `DetailedSchema` is here:
```json
{"map":[
  {
    "k":{"bytes":"8badf00d"},
    "v":{"bytes":"deadbeef"}
  },
  {
    "k":{"int":9},
    "v":{"int":5}
  },
  {
    "k":{"string":"obj"},
    "v":{"map":[
      {
        "k":{"string":"a"},
        "v":{"list":[
          {"map":[
            {
              "k":{"int":5},
              "v":{"int":2}
            }
          ]},
          {"map":[
          ]}
        ]}
      }
    ]}
  }
]}
```

All values are represented as an object with 1 field with the key tagging the type and the value being the value itself.
This is the exact same metadata as the `BasicConversions` example which should illustrate that it is much more verbose to use this format,
but it can represent every kind of metadata possible, including non-string/byte/int keys.
Do note that byte strings do not start with "0x", unlike with `BasicConversions`.

This additional freedom in keys can be seen here:
```json
{"map":[
  {
    "k":{"list":[
      {"map": [
        {
          "k": {"int": 5},
          "v": {"int": 7}
        },
        {
          "k": {"string": "hello"},
          "v": {"string": "world"}
        }
      ]},
      {"bytes": "ff00ff00"}
    ]},
    "v":{"int":5}
  }
]}
```
has a 1-element map with a value of just 5, but with a very complicated key consisting of a list with 2 elements:
* a 2-element map (5 => 7, "hello" => "world")
* a bytestring (0xFF00FF00)

Most reasonable metadata formats, however, likely do not use map/key/compound keys and thus this is more of a fringe use or when all possible metadata must be examined from JSON (almost) without exception.
Due to library implementation details it can still fail to decode if there is a very negative number between `-2^64 + 1` and `-2^63`.

## Using a CDDL Subset

Upsides:
* Automatic structural typing in deserialization
* Readable by other methods
* Possible reduced space due to array structs not serializing keys

Downsides:
* Requires additional set-up

For static or relatively static types this is probably the best choice, especially if you care about structural validation or need the binary types or more complex keys.

As we saw in the other examples, most reasonable structures can be encoded using the standard metadata CDDL as it is almost a superset of JSON outside of true/false/null. Not only this, but if we represent a struct using an array in CDDL such as:
```
foo = [
  receiver_id: text,
  sender_id: text,
  comment: text,
  tags: [*int]
]
```
there is space savings as the keys are not stored as it is represented as an ordered array of 4 elements instead of a direct map encoding of:
```
foo = {
  receiver_id: text,
  sender_id: text,
  comment: text,
  tags": [*int]
}
```
which would serialize the keys as strings inside the resulting CBOR. Using these CDDL definitions for the example JSON structure we had results in sizes of 89 bytes for the array definition and 124 bytes for the map one. Using the JSON encoding would also result in a metadata size of 124 bytes. Maps however do have the advantage of easy optional fields and a more readable metadata for external users who don't have access to the CDDL as the field names will be stored directly.

After you have created your CDDL definition, if you need to check that your CDDL conforms to the metadata CDDL we have a tool located in the `/tools/metadata-cddl-checker/` directory. Move to this directory and put your CDDL in a file called `input.cddl` there first, then run

```
cargo build
cargo run
```

Once we have the CDDL file and it has passed metadata format validation we can use the [cddl-codegen](https://github.com/Emurgo/cddl-codegen) tool that we used to initially generate the serialization/deserialization/structural code for the core Shelley structures from the [shelley cddl spec](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/blob/master/shelley/chain-and-ledger/shelley-spec-ledger-test/cddl-files/shelley.cddl).

Assuming we are in the `cddl-codegen` root directory and have created a `input.cddl` file in that directory containing the CDDL we wish to generate we can build and code-generate with
```
cargo build
cargo run
```
which should generate a wasm-convertible rust library for parsing our CDDL definition in the `/export/` directory.
After this we need to generate a wasm package from the rust code by running the following (you can do `--target=browser` too)
```
cd export
wasm-pack build --target=nodejs
wasm-pack pack
```

which should give you the library as a package in the `/pkg/` directory.

Once we have imported the library we can then use it as such:
```javascript
const tags = OurMetadataLib.Ints.new();
// if we have smaller (32-bit signed) numbers we can construct easier
tags.add(OurMetadataLib.Int.new_i32(0));
// but for bigger (>= 2^32) numbers we must use BigNum and specify the sign ourselves
tags.add(OurMetadataLib.Int.new(CardanoWasm.Int.from_str("264")));
// and for negative large (< -2^32) numbers (here we construct -1024)
tags.add(OurMetadataLib.Int.new_negative(CardanoWasm.Int.from_str("1024")));
tags.add(OurMetadataLib.Int.new_i32(32));
const map = OurMetadataLib.Foo.new("SJKdj34k3jjKFDKfjFUDfdjkfd", "jkfdsufjdk34h3Sdfjdhfduf873", "happy birthday", tags)
let metadata;
try {
  metadata = CardanoWasm.TransactionMetadata.from_bytes(map.to_bytes());
} catch (e) {
  // this should never happen if OurMetadataLib was generated from compatible CDDL with the metadata definition
}
```

likewise you can parse the metadata back very simply with:
```javascript
let cddlMetadata;
try {
  cddlMetadata = OurMetadataLib.Foo.from_bytes(metadata.to_bytes());
} catch (e) {
  // this should never happen if OurMetadataLib was generated from compatible CDDL with the metadata definition
}
// we can now directly access the fields with cddlMetadata.receiver_id(), etc
```

If we take advantage of the additional primitives not defined in CDDL but defined for `cddl-codegen`, then we can specify precisions of `u32`, `u64`, `i64`, `i32` for specifying 32 or 64 bits instead of just a general purpose `uint`/`nint`/`int`.
If you know your metadata will always be within one of these ranges it can be much more convenient to work with, and if you have signed data this will also make it easier to work with instead of the `Int` class that CDDL `int` might generate, since that is either an up to 64-bit positive or an up to 64 negative numbers.
This is particularly useful here as lists of CDDL primitives can be exposed directly as `Vec<T>` to wasm from rust, but when we have `int` (converts to `Int` struct) or `uint` (converts to `BigNum` struct) a separate structure like that `Ints` one used above is used. Using the 32-bit versions allows direct js `number` conversions to/from wasm.

If we simply change the `tags` field to `tags: [+i32]` our code becomes:
```javascript
// notice how we can directly work with js numbers here now!
// but remember they must fit into a 32-bit number now - no 64-bit numbers like are allowed in the metadata
const tags = [0, 264, -1024, 32];
const map = OurMetadataLib.Foo.new("SJKdj34k3jjKFDKfjFUDfdjkfd", "jkfdsufjdk34h3Sdfjdhfduf873", "happy birthday", tags)
```

and deserializaing likewise is much simpler as `metadata.tags()` will return a JS array or numbers rather than a rust-wasm struct that must be accessed via the wasm boundary.

## Raw Bytes Encoding

Upsides:
* Can store arbitrary data
* Potential space-savings if the data is compressed

Downsides:
* Not readable by other methods - must be decoded using this method
* Requires additional set-up

While most data would likely conform to the metadata CDDL subset (or JSON), if your data does not fit there then this encoding style will be necessary.

If you still want to take advantage of CDDL type-checking it is possible to create a library just as in the CDDL subset section but without running the checker tool. This could be useful if you are using CDDL outside of the metadata CDDL structure. Otherwise, you can store whatever bytes you want.

*Note*: To conform with the 64-byte limitation on metadata binary values, this method will split the bytes into 64-byte chunks

```javascript
const bytes = /* whatever method you want - you can use the CDDL solution in the 3rd option here */
const metadata = CardanoWasm.encode_arbitrary_bytes_as_metadatum(bytes);
const decoded_bytes = CardanoWasm.decode_arbitrary_bytes_from_metadatum(metadata);
assertEquals(bytes, decoded_bytes);
```

# Multi-Era

This crate contains all the on-chain types for previous eras (Byron, Shelley, Alonzo, Babbage, etc). There are also wrappers around this era if you need era-agnostic types e.g. parsing all blocks from genesis. The wrappers support the current era as well.

## Parsing blocks across eras

`MultiEraBlock` can be used for this. Take care about the format you are giving it. Some tools (e.g. Pallas/Oura) won't give you the block format from the binary spec directly, but will instead have it wrapped in some network wrapper array containing the explicit era tag. If your CBOR looks like `[uint, <actual block here>]` (likely starting with `82` in hex e.g. `8201`, `8204`, `8207`, etc) then you should use `MultiEraBlock.from_explicit_network_cbor_bytes()` instead of `MultiEraBlock.from_cbor_bytes()`.

# WASM Usage

## Memory Management

If you are using CML from the browser this section is likely irrelevant for you.
Using CML from a javascript environment with weakrefs enabled should have automatic memory cleanup.
If this is not the case (e.g. non-javascript/typescript WASM environment), or you are using CML inside of a very tight loop that is executed hundreds of thousands of times in a short period it might be advisable to explicitly call `.free()` on any CML types after they are used.
This is because while from an environment with weakrefs the types will eventually be freed automatically,
it is still possible to use excessive memory or run out if, for example, large CML types are created in a constant loop that runs many times (e.g. hundreds of thousands of times without a break), as the automatic cleanup will not be run in time. Do not worry about this for normal CML usage.
Do not call `.free()` on a type or use it after `.free()` has been called on it already.
WASM types passed into other CML APIs will be done so by reference and will not have their `.free()` method called just by doing so, but will still eventually be cleaned up if weakrefs are available.
