# Verifying that you are up and running

## Prerequisites verification

Before verifying your Blockfrost platform operation, make sure that these critical configurations are correct:

### A running Cardano node

A running mainnet (production) instance of cardano-node with a public IP address.

### NFT address configuration

**Important:** You must use the exact address containing your Icebreaker NFT, not your general wallet address.

When running the init command or configuring manually, use the specific address containing the NFT:

```shell
--reward-address addr1xxx...  # Address containing NFT, not general wallet address
```

Your wallet likely contains multiple addresses.
The platform requires specifically the address where the NFT resides.
Check your wallet to identify which address holds the Icebreaker NFT.

### Network port configuration

Make sure that your required ports are properly opened.
The default Blockfrost platform port is `3000`.

#### For cloud hosting

- Azure: Create a new outbound rule allowing port 3000 traffic

- AWS: Configure security groups to permit port 3000 traffic

- Other providers: Update firewall settings accordingly.

## Basic service verification

After confirming prerequisites, verify the service itself:

### Installation verification

Confirm that the software is properly installed:

```shell
blockfrost-platform --version
```

This should return the current version number.

### Service startup verification

Start the service and check for successful initialization:

```shell
blockfrost-platform --node-socket-path /path/to/node.socket \
                    --secret your_icebreaker_secret \
                    --reward-address your_nft_address
```

In the logs, you should see initialization messages.
The message `DEBUG: Decoding done` indicates normal operation.

If you don't see this message or encounter errors, check:

- Node socket path accessibility
- Secret key validity.

### Operational verification

Once the service is running, verify that it is functioning correctly:

### Understanding the UUID

When running in non-solitary mode, the Blockfrost platform generates a new UUID each time it starts.
This UUID is used as a prefix for routing requests through the Icebreakers load balancers.

### Example log entry showing UUID

```
INFO: Your instance ID: 3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

You would need this UUID for things like your own manual transaction submission tests.
Otherwise, it's an implementation detail.
In solitary mode, no UUID is generated.
Remember that this changes every time you restart the service.

### Metrics endpoint verification

Check if your service is properly reporting metrics:

```shell
wget http://your-server-ip:3000/metrics
```

If functioning properly, this endpoint provides:

- API calls served count
- Resource utilization statistics
- Uptime information.

Note: The metrics endpoint may require the latest binary.
If you receive a 500 error, update your installation.

### Health endpoint verification

Check if your service is up and running by calling the health endpoint:

```shell
wget http://your-server-ip:3000/
```

If working properly, this endpoint will return JSON with service status details such as:

- Application name
- Current release version
- Revision (Git commit hash)
- Boolean indicating overall health (`healthy`)
- Block, epoch, era, slot, and sync progress info
- Array listing any issues detected

If `healthy` is true, the service is operational.
If you get a 503 error or if `healthy` is false, check your logs or update your installation to resolve potential issues.

## Icebreaker dashboard monitoring

For a visual verification of your node's status, access the Icebreaker dashboard at [https://icebreakers.blockfrost.io/](https://icebreakers.blockfrost.io/)

Your node will appear as 'Icebreaker X' where X is your assigned number (visible in your NFT metadata).

This dashboard provides:

- Connection status
- Performance metrics
- Comparison with other Icebreaker nodes.

## Troubleshooting common issues

If verification fails, check these common issues:

### Not seeing 'Decoding done' message

- Ensure your Cardano node is fully synced
- Check node socket path accessibility.

### Cannot access metrics endpoint

- Confirm port 3000 is accessible from your network
- Make sure metrics are not disabled (`--no-metrics` flag or config).

### Receiving 503 errors under load

- The server has a concurrency limit (default: 8192 concurrent requests). If exceeded, additional requests receive a 503 response.
- Increase the limit with `--server-concurrency-limit` if needed.

### Not appearing in Grafana

- Allow up to 10 minutes for your node to appear
- Verify your NFT address is correctly configured
- Ensure outbound connections are permitted by your firewall.
